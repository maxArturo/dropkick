# dropkick

Spiritual successor to [amalgam](https://github.com/maxArturo/amalgam). Uses a functional-style TS to aggregate news links and render with minimal browser JS/overhead.

Current sources supported:
* hacker news
* /r/programming

## Driving impetus

* JS isn't needed if you're just aggregating news/links of interest
* humble hosting requirements
* Roll your own aggregation

## Guiding Principles

* No JS
* Fast/small page size (should run decently on decades-old hardware), vanilla HTML
* Text/Email friendly
* easily extensible (bring your own news source)
